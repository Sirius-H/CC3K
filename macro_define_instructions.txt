EASYMODE – easy mode: (more gold, NPC 1/2 HP)
MEDIUMMODE - medium mode: (normal mode)
HARDMODE - hard mode: (less gold, NPC 1.5X Atk) (to be implemented)

// For demo:

SHOWPC - show the map with only pc generated
SHOWSTAIR - show the map with pc, stair generated
SHOWPOTION - show the map with pc, stair, potions (including their location and type) generated
SHOWTREASURE - show the map with pc, stair, potions and treasures (including their location and type) generated

CUSTOMIZEDREADMAP - our method of reading in floors (read in extra info lines (see below))



####### Floor.txt Requirement:

(1) Each floor (map) must be a rectangle. Walls are defined by '|' and '-'. Passages are defined by '+' and '#'. 
    And floors are defined by '.'.
(2) Each map is followed by some (maybe 0) lines of information about where each type of item/NPC will be spawned at.
(3) We assume that each info line is valid:
	i.e., you are not putting any item on an occupied cell or inside walls/passages, and all the requirements below are met.)
(4) By default, PC and all NPCs are spawned with 100% HP. However, you can make the game easier by using the macro "EASYMODE".
    (In this ase, all NPCs will only have 1/2 HP.)
(5) floor.txt (name can be different) should contain exactly 5 maps (even though each map is the same). There can be 0 or 
    multiple lines of info followed by it. The maps are default to be empty, but you can add the items at locations which 
    are specified below in the info section. But remember, the added items (except walls and passages) are not recorded unless
    you specify them in the info section manually!!! (i.e.: if an item is shown in map but is not stated in the info section,
    then it won't be generated.)
(6) If none of the 5 maps contains PC '@', then we'll treat this as a new game and randomly generate items on each map.
       

(7) For info line:
	For each line, the input should be in the format of "x y CHAR effect_code", where x and y are integers representing the
    location of the item to be spawned at. CHAR represents the item you wish to create and its effect code (see below).
	(a) For PC (@), there should be an integers from 0 to 3 following it showing the character the player wish to play as.
		(0-human, 1-dwarf, 2-elves, 3-orc)
	(b) For each treasure(G), it must be followed by a number from 6 to 9 representing the type of gold pile:
		(6-normal gold pile, 7-small horde, 8-merchant horde, 9-dragon horde)
	(c) For NPC, you need to specify with type of NPC it is. (e.g.: (V)Vampire, (W)Werewolf, (N)Goblin, (M)Merchant, (D)Dragon,
        (X)Phoenix, (T)Troll). The effect code is either 0 or 1, representing that whether it holds the compass.
	(d) For each Dragon horde or BarrierSuit spawned, there must be a following line showing a guardian dragon, which must
		be 1 unit around it. (i.e.: the dragon's coordinate must be (x +/- 1, y +/- 1))
	(e) For each Potion(P), it must be followed by a number from 0 to 5 representing its effect:
		(0-Restore Health, 1-Boost Attack, 2-Boost Defence, 3-Poison Health, 4-Wound Attack, 5-Wound Defence)
     
    Samples:
    4 9 @ 0 // spawn a Player Character of Human at location (4,9)
    2 3 G 6 // spawn a Treaure of normal gold pile at location (2,3)
    6 6 T 0 // spawn a Troll (NPC) at location (6,6) (it does not carry the compass)
    2 5 G 9 // spawn a Treasure of dragon horde at location (2,5)
    2 6 D // if the previous line is a dragon horde or a barrier suit, this line must be spawn a dragon 1 unit around it
    4 5 B // spawn a Barrier Suit at location (4,5)
    4 3 D // same as dragon horde: a guaidian dragon must exist 1 unit around the barrier suit.
    2 2 P 2 // spawn a Potion of Boost Attack at location (2,2)
    9 9 S // spawn a Stair at (9,9)
